This (by default collapsed) table shows the heroes and tokens you get for winning a match.  
* Normal/Ranked games give +3 tokens for a win, +1 token for a loss.  
* Turbo gives +2 out of 3 random tokens on a win, 0 on a loss.  
* The `DifficultyScore` column is the individual difficulty of the hero. The algorithm uses this as a *cost* and tries to minimize it.
* You can edit the `DifficultyScore` and **increase** the number if you want the hero to be less likely to be chosen. 
  * Setting the value to `200` would mean that you would play 2 games with another hero or 1 game with this hero.
  * Setting the value to `101` would only mean that algorithm would choose the alternative option if available.
